3 Types Of JavaScript 

1. Function Declarations
Definition: A function declaration defines a named function. It can be called before it is defined in the code due to hoisting.

2. Function Expressions
Definition: A function expression defines a function and assigns it to a variable. It is not hoisted, so it must be defined before 
it is used.

3. Arrow Functions
Definition: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions. They do not have their own this context and are typically 
used for short functions.

4.Anonymous Functions
An anonymous function is simply a function that does not have a name. Unlike named functions, which are declared with a name for easy 
reference, anonymous functions are usually created for specific tasks and are often assigned to variables or used as arguments for other 
functions.
