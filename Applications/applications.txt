Different Kind Of JavaScripts:
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


1. Vanilla JavaScript:

Vanilla JavaScript refers to plain, standard JavaScript without the use of any additional libraries or frameworks. It’s the core language 
itself, used directly in browsers or Node.js environments.

Use Case: You use Vanilla JavaScript when you want complete control and don’t need complex tools or frameworks.


2. Node.js:
::::::::::::

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, mainly on servers. It’s used 

for building server-side applications.


Use Case: You use Node.js when building backend services, APIs, or real-time applications like chat apps.


3. TypeScript:
:::::::::::::::

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch errors during development and makes your code more predictable.
TypeScript is compiled into plain JavaScript that runs in browsers or Node.js.

Use Case: You use TypeScript when working on large-scale projects or when you need more structured code.

4. React (React.js):
::::::::::::::::::::
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It focuses on creating reusable UI 
components and efficiently updating the UI as data changes.

Example: Imagine Lego blocks that snap together to build various structures. Each Lego block (component) is like a piece of UI in React.

Use Case: You use React when you want to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, especially when dealing with a lot of data.



5. Vue.js:
:::::::::::::
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It’s known for being simple, 
flexible, and easy to integrate into existing projects.

Example: Think of Vue.js as a chef’s assistant who helps with preparing dishes. It can work alone or assist in large projects.

Use Case: You use Vue.js when you need an easy-to-learn, yet powerful, framework for building dynamic interfaces.
