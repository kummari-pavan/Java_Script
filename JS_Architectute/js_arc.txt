Java Script architecture 

Single-threaded: 
----------------
JavaScript works on one task at a time, which means it can do only one thing at a time.
This makes it easy to manage but can slow down if there are big tasks.

Event-driven:   
------------- 
JavaScript waits for actions to happen, like a click on a button, and then runs the code related to that event.

Non-blocking:  
------------- 
Even though it's single-threaded, JavaScript doesn't get stuck waiting for something like data from the internet.
It keeps running other code until the data is ready.

JavaScript Engine:
-----------------
The code runs in a special engine inside the web browser.
This engine turns our code into machine language that the computer understands.
