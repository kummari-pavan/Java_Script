1. JavaScript Variables

1.1 Variable Declaration
Variables are like containers for storing values. We can create a variable using the let,var,const keyword.

var  --> declares a variable with function or global scope and is hoisted to the top.
let --> declares a block-scoped variable that is not hoisted and can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.
const --> declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be updated or redeclared, and must be initialized at the time of declaration.

1.2 Assigning a Value to the Variable
We can put data into a variable using an assignment operator (=).
