Higher-Order Functions:
-----------------------
Higher-order functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and functional programming.
 Understanding them can greatly enhance your ability to write concise and powerful code. 
 
A higher-order function is a function that:
Takes one or more functions as arguments, or
Returns a function as a result.

1. Function as an Argument
----------------------------
You can pass a function as an argument to another function. This is useful for operations that need to be customizable.

Example: Array map() Method

The map() method is a classic higher-order function. It applies a function to each item in an array and returns a new array with the results.


const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Function to double each number
function double(number) {
    return number * 2;
}

// Using map() with the double function
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(double);

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
